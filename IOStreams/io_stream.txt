IO Stream: 
=======

Bytes Streams
==============
OutputStream: abstract class
InputStream: abstract class
 
FileInputStream and FileOutputStream: is used to read and write data as bytes from file.

DataInputStream and DataOutputStream: is used to read and write data as primitive data.

ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream: is used to read and write data as object.

BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream: is used to read and write data as buffers.

Characters Streams:
=================
Writer(abstract class): output stream
Reader(abstract class): input stream

FileWriter and FileReader: 
1. are used to read and write data from a file as characters
2. Using FileReader class we cannot read one line at a time from a file. we can only read character at time, it reduces the reading
performance of the application.

BufferedWriter and BufferedReader: to improve reading and writing capability of the other input and output stream.

OutputStreamReader and InputStreamReader: 

1. An OutputStreamWriter is a bridge form characters streams to byte streams: characters written to it are encoded into 
bytes using a specified charset.
2. An InputStreamReader is a bridge form bytes streams to characters streams: it reads bytes and decodes them into characters 
using a specified charset.


Note: It is recommanded to use FileReader and FileWriter classes to read data from text file
whereas FileInputStream and FileOutStream classes are only recommanded to use reading and writing image files.

 
PrintStream: 
======== 
This class is a filter stream class used to write data as it is in the given format. Unlike FileOutputStream, this class writes 97
as 97 rather than 'a'.
